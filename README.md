### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate computer science student at Dalhousie University. Currently, I am in the 4th term studying some advanced concepts in Web Development and Network Security. In my previous terms, I have enjoyed learning, experimenting and exploring the field of Data Analytics, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, and Software Development. I have been a part of many group projects some of which I have showcased here. As a graduate student, I have honed my skills and picked up some new ones.
